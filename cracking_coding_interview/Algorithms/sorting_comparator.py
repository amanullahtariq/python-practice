# Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array. The Player class is provided in the editor below; it has two fields:
#
# A string, .
# An integer, .
# Given an array of  Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if  or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.
#
# Input Format
#
# Locked stub code in the Solution class handles the following input from stdin:
# The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of players.
# Each of the  subsequent lines contains a player's respective  and .
#
# Constraints
#
# Two or more players can have the same name.
# Player names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters.
# Output Format
#
# You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout. Locked stub code in Solution will create a Checker object, use it to sort the Player array, and print each sorted element.
#
# Sample Input
#
# 5
# amy 100
# david 100
# heraldo 50
# aakansha 75
# aleksa 150
#
# Sample Output
#
# aleksa 150
# amy 100
# david 100
# aakansha 75
# heraldo 50
# Explanation
#
# As you can see, the players are first sorted by decreasing score and then sorted alphabetically by name.
